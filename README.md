# MotionEmulator

Android motion simulator with sensor support.

## Scenarios

If you study in universities in China, there'll be
no necessity to explain it.

Despite how hard the faculty tries to make us take an
after-dinner sunny long run at dusk every one thirds day,
we always want to create something innovative to make the life a little
bit easier.

## Usage

* Pick up your phone and turn on the motion recorder
* Take a one-hundred-meter speed run and press `STOP`
* Draw the path you desire to be running on, like the one
revolves around the mainland, probably using polyline
* Set time limit and repeat count
* Make more time
